          <h3>Who I am</h3>
          <p>
            Born in Lubin, Poland in 2001. What pushed me into moving abroad was
            my curiosity about the world and desire to meet new people.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am always motivated and eager to gain new experience. I am quick
            to adapt to the new situations and groups. Lerning fast is also not
            a problem for me. I am that kind of person who has a plan if the
            backup plan for a backup plan wouldn't work but when I see a good
            opportunity I am quick to make a decission.

          I am on the frontend specialisation and I am most passionate about
          programming. Through the last semesters I have been mostly working
          mostly with HTML and CSS. Even though I have been introduced to
          JavaScript just recently I feel this is something I want to work with.
          I also had some oportunities to work with Python and C++ and I am
          planning on mastering those languages in the future as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          While my main focus lays on developing my programming skills I also
          care a lot about creating best possible design. Whether it is a layout
          of the website or a piece of art I have to create, I always try to
          make it look perfect. In order to do that I work mostly with Adobe Xd
          and Adobe Photoshop but I am also familiar with other Adobe programs
          like Illustrator, Animate and Premiere Pro.

                Well, about frontend of course! But beside that I really love
                playing Dungeons & Dragons. It may be just a game but a lot of
                creative and tactical thinking is needed to actually play it. I
                am known for always finding a way out from difficult situations
                and surviving whatever is thrown at me.
              </p>
              <p>
                I play a lot of different games both multplayer where I have to
                cooperate with strangers and singleplayer for boosting my
                imagination.

          </div>

          <p>
            As they say: "a healthy mind in a healthy body", so I never limited
            myself to just sitting in front of computer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was part of the airsoft group for a few years back in Poland. I'm
            not going to lie, I was terrible at aiming. Fortunately I was pretty
            good at navigating which was crucial skill in huge forests,
            especially at night with no light source. As one of the older
            members I often helped with organising events and creating tactics
            for longer games.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have also trained Krav Maga, Takwondo and Karate Kyokushin. Most
            of the time I was the one collecting all of the punches but small
            inconveniences has never stopped me from doing what I want to.

            In Business Academy Aarhus the ability of cooperating in groups is
            of great importance. Most of the work I heve done were group

        <h2>How I work on the projects</h2>
        <p>
          In a group work there are almost never situtions where only one person
          is working on certian element and working together always holds a lot
          of challanges. Using right tools is extremely impoertant here and I am
          always quick to adapt knowledge about new ones.
        </p>
        <div>
          <img alt="github" src="#" />

          <img alt="miro" src="#" />
          <img alt="trello" src="#" />
        </div>
        <p>
          The main tools I use are Adobe Xd for creating prototypes with my
          group and GitHub for coding together. Google Drive is perfect for
          sharing all of the files and Trello for creating action plan. For
          bigger projects I use platforms like Miro to map the ideas. As no
          project will go without ussability testing I use Loom for in-person
          tests and Lookback for online ones.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every group has their own preferences when it comes to using tools and
          I am always quick to adapt to the new working environment.
