            <h3>Who I am</h3>
            <span class="red-line-p"></span>
            <p>
              Born in Lubin, Poland in 2001. What pushed me into
              moving abroad was my curiosity about the world and
              desire to meet new people.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am always motivated and eager to gain new experience.
              I am quick to adapt to the new situations and groups of people.
              Learning fast is also not a problem for me. I am that
              kind of person who has a plan if the backup plan for a
              backup plan wouldn't work but when I see a good
              opportunity I am quick to make a decision.
            </p>
            <p>
              What I seek is gainnig new experience and knowledge. I
              want to test my abilities outside of the school
              environment and prove that I got what it takes to become
              a pro frontend developer.

              I am on the frontend specialisation and I am most
              passionate about programming. Through the last semesters
              I have been working mostly with HTML and CSS. Even
              though I have been introduced to JavaScript just
              recently I feel this is something I want to work with. I
              also had some oportunities to work with Python and C++
              and I am planning on mastering those languages in the
              future as well.
            </p>
            <span class="red-line-p"></span>
            <p>
              While my main focus lays on developing my programming
              skills I also care a lot about creating best possible
              design. Whether it is a layout of the website or an
              illustration I have to create, I always try to make it
              look perfect. In order to do that I work mostly with
              Adobe Xd and Adobe Photoshop but I am also familiar with
              other Adobe programs like Illustrator, Animate and
              Premiere Pro.

                Well, frontend of course! But beside that I really
                love playing Dungeons & Dragons. It may be just a game
                but a lot of creative and tactical thinking is needed
                to actually play it. I am known for always finding a
                way out from difficult situations and surviving
                whatever is thrown at me.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also play a lot of different computer games, both
                multplayer where I have to cooperate with strangers
                and singleplayer for boosting my imagination.

                As they say: "a healthy mind in a healthy body", so I
                never limited myself to just sitting in front of
                computer.

                I was part of the airsoft group for a few years back
                in Poland. I'm not going to lie, I was terrible at
                aiming. Fortunately I was pretty good at navigating
                which was crucial skill in huge forests, especially at
                night with no light source. As one of the older
                members I often helped with organising events and
                creating tactics for longer games.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have also trained Krav Maga, Taekwondo and Karate
                Kyokushin. Most of the time I was the one collecting
                all of the punches but small inconveniences have never
                stopped me from doing what I am passionate about.

              In Business Academy Aarhus the ability of cooperating in
              groups is of great importance. Most of the work I have
              done were group projects nad I always made shure to try
              to contribute even to the parts I do not specialise in.
              I never pass the opportunity to learn new things!

          <p>
            In a group work there are almost never situtions where
            only one person is working on certian element and working
            together always holds a lot of challanges. Using right
            tools is extremely impoertant here and I am always quick
            to adapt knowledge about new ones.

            The main tools I use are Adobe Xd for creating prototypes
            with my group and GitHub for coding together. Google Drive
            is perfect for sharing all of the files and Trello for
            creating action plan. For bigger projects I use platforms
            like Miro to map the ideas. As no project will go without
            ussability testing I use Loom for in-person tests and
            Lookback for online ones.
          </p>

          <p>
            Every group has their own preferences when it comes to
            using tools and I am always quick to adapt to the new
            working environment.
